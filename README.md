# Next-Nike-Store-in-New-Mexico
## Location Recommendation of New Nike Store  
### This is a personal indepentent project. This project is only used for academic exchanges and supporting materials for applications. It can not be used for any commercial purposes.

In this projct, I used Google Map and Foursquare API to collect the data of nearby venues (including the number of restaurants, stadiums, shops, bus stops and so on) of 80 existing Nike stores and 70 unsuitable locations for stores. Then,I built a decision tree model based on the data to predict which location in Santa Fe might be appropriate for a future Nike store. I also made a radar plot to characterize the existing Nike stores and the unsuitable locations, and visualized the predicted locations on a Folium map.

Because GitHub can't display some pictures and text effects, I took some screen shots of my Jupyter Notebook, and create a PDF file to show the result.  
If you are interested in this project and want to see the full display effect, please contact me and I can send you the whole original package.
